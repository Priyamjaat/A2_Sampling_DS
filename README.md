## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to understand the importance of
sampling techniques in handling imbalanced datasets and to analyze how
different sampling strategies affect the performance of machine learning models.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is a highly imbalanced credit card dataset.
It contains transaction-related features and a target variable
indicating fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Dataset Source (Provided):  
Creditcard_data.csv

## Sampling Techniques Applied
The following sampling techniques were applied to balance the dataset:

1. Random Under Sampling  
2. Random Over Sampling  
3. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)  
4. NearMiss  
5. Tomek Links

## Machine Learning Models Used
Five different machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

---

## Evaluation Metric
- Accuracy Score was used to evaluate and compare model performance
  across different sampling techniques.

---

## Results
The results of all model and sampling combinations are stored in:
